# Sources for Topical Bible Data

## OpenBible.info

Stephen Smith conducted a crowdsourcing experiment by allowing users
to add and vote on passages for topics, and suggest additional
topics. There are currently 1350 topics with a wide range of passages. 

The topics probably do a good job of reflecting the breadth of issues
for which people want scriptural guidance. The quality of the
suggested passages is not guaranteed, however.

## Dictionary of Bible Themes

This is a well-curated and organized "thematic" resource. At its lower
levels it is much more granular than a typical inventory of Bible
topics.

* [Topical Bible Questions (All) |
  GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/questions_topical-Bible.html)
  is a list of ~640 questions and links to articles providing
  commentary on the issue. They probably reflect a broad range of
  interests. The answers may sometimes skew more conservative, but the
  questions themselves (and the related passages) are important
  topical content. Biblica might approach them about obtaining their data.
